## [Project 1 - Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Intro_to_Machine_Learning_with_PyTorch_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Finding%20Donors%20for%20CharityML)

The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learning algorithms to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield for CharityML while under some marketing constraints. At its core, this project involves binary classification of data based on an individual's income.

* Key techniques used:
  * Supervised learning algorithms (i.e. Random Forest, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines)
  * Model evaluation and comparison
  * Model tuning using grid search
  * Most predictive features extraction

## [Project 2 - CIFAR10 Image Classifier](https://github.com/IvanBabkin/Udacity_Intro_to_Machine_Learning_with_PyTorch_Nanodegree/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20CIFAR10%20Image%20Classifier)

The goal of this project is to build a neural network based image classifier using PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy.

* Key techniques used:
  * Convolutional neural network architecture design
  * Stochastic gradient descent
  * Deep learning with PyTorch
