# Project 2 - CIFAR10 Image Classifier
The management of a fictional self-driving car startup is trying to decide whether to build or buy an object detection algorithm. But before making this purchase, management wants to explore whether it is possible to build an in-house solution that performs well. The aim of this project is to try and create a neural network that can classify arbitrary objects and potentially be fine-tuned on a larger dataset using transfer learning. Ultimately, the task is to build a neural network based image classifier using PyTorch for the CIFAR10 dataset and evaluate its accuracy.

Key techniques used:
  * Convolutional neural network architecture design
  * Stochastic gradient descent
  * Deep learning with PyTorch

**This project consists of three files**:
1. Project report jupyter notebook (CIFAR10_Image_Classifier.ipynb)
2. Project report html file (CIFAR10_Image_Classifier.html)
3. Saved model file (CIFAR10_model_checkpoint.pth)
