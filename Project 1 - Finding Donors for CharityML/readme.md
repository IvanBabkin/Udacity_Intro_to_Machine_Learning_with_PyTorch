# Project 1 - Finding Donors for CharityML
In this project, several supervised learning algorithms (Random Forest, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines) are employed to accurately model individuals' income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then, the best candidate algorithm is chosen from preliminary results and further optimized to best model the data. Finally, the most important predictive features from the dataset are extracted, and an analysis is carried out to determine whether it will be worthwhile to train the optimized model with only the most important features rather than all present features in the dataset. The aim of this implementation is to construct a model that most accurately classifies individuals in the dataset based on their income.

Key techniques used:
  * Supervised learning algorithms (i.e. Random Forest, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines)
  * Model evaluation and comparison
  * Model tuning using grid search
  * Most predictive features extraction
