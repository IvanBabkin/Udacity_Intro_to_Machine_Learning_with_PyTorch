    "### 1.1 Project Motivation\n",
    "CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML wants to build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce the overhead cost of sending mail. The goal of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learning algorithms to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent due to marketing budget constraints.\n",

    "In this project, several supervised learning algorithms (Random Forest, AdaBoost and Support Vector Machines (SVM)) are employed to accurately model individuals' income using the data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. Then, the best candidate algorithm is chosen from preliminary results and further optimized to best model the data. The goal of this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than \\$50,000. In the real world, this sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request or whether or not they should reach out, to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, it is possible to infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "### 1.2 The Dataset\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). This dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. The article by Ron Kohavi can be found [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data investigated here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries.\n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `capital-gain` and `capital-loss`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. However, care must be taken when applying this transformation: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so the values must be translated by a small amount above `0` to apply the logarithm successfully."

    "### 3.2 Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `capital-gain` or `capital-loss` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. The [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) will be used for this procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below."

For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. This feature is then encoded into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is a weighted average (harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score."

Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performance would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that does not make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is more important than the model's ability to recall those individuals. This means that in this case, **precision** would be valued more than the recall metric. Additionally, **F-beta score** could be used as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",

Making such a statement would be called *naive*, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for the data to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

However, it is the worst performer when considering the test set as shown in the tabular output, suggesting that the algorithm overfits the data. Overall, all three models have a similar accuracy metric performance on the test set, with AdaBoostClassifier performing slightly better than the other two algorithms. With regards to the f-score, AdaBoostClassifier clearly outperforms the other two algorithms, consistently having a higher score for all sample sizes. Such performance is to be expected from the algorithm as this is a binary classification problem which is where the AdaBoostClassifier performs best. Lastly, it is important to note on top of having the best metric scores, AdaBoostClassifier was also the fastest model having the lowest prediction and training times out of all three algorithms."

    "AdaBoost algorithm, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a boosting technique used as an ensemble method in machine learning. Essentially the aim of the technique is to set weights to data points and classifiers in a way that forces classifiers to concentrate on records that are difficult to correctly classify.\n",
    "\n",
    "AdaBoostClassifier takes the following steps. Firstly, a weak learner is chosen. A weak learner is a classifier that has a better prediction than the naive predictor, for instance, a decision tree. This first weak learner is fit to maximise the accuracy. Then, the objective of the second weak learner is to fix the mistakes of the first one, and hence the misclassified data points are given higher weights to punish the model more for misclassifying those points. The process of increasingly punishing the weak learners for misclassified points of the previous learner is iterated, and the weak learners are then combined to make a final ensemble model. In the final model, each learner votes to predict a person's income being more than 50k or not, and the model takes the majority of the votes to make a final prediction."

    "####  Observations\n",
    "The visualisation above confirms that the first 3 features that were selected based on simply observing the data are indeed among the top five most predictive features. Moreover, capital gain, capital loss and age are also the top 3 most predictive features as deduced from pure observation and logic. Hence, I believe that these features are indeed the most predictive due to the reasoning outlined above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the graph illustrates that education level and occupation are not among the most predictive features. Instead, hours worked per week and sex are more predictive than the previously described features. Hours per week could be an important predictive feature as it is possible that individuals who work more hours earn more money for their efforts and hence have a higher income. Furthermore, the graph shows that sex is an important predictor of an individual's income. The dataset, therefore, illustrates the disparities in pay between different sexes, and this could be explained that by the fact that, unfortunately, there is a pay gap where women, on average, are paid less than men.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, it is important to note that while the graph shows capital gain, capital loss, age, hours per week and sex as the top predictive features, the predictive importance of hours per week, sex and even age is significantly smaller than that of capital gain and capital loss variables."

    "### 6.3 Feature Selection\n",
    "From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half (around 75%) of the importance of all features present in the data. This hints that it is possible to reduce the feature space and simplify the information required for the model to learn. Therefore, another instance of AdaBoostClassifier will be trained on the same dataset but containing only the five most important predictive features. With fewer features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics.  The code cell below compares the metrics and training and prediction time of the optimized model found earlier using the full features dataset and reduced features dataset."

    "#### Effects of Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be seen from the output above, the accuracy and the f-score metrics decrease if the optimized AdaBoostClassifier would be trained on the reduced data. For the accuracy score, the decrease is from 0.8659 to 0.8247, and while it is arguably not that significant, the gained time from using reduced data is only around 4 seconds and therefore, it is not worth sacrificing accuracy for a relatively small decrease in training and predicting time. Similarly, and more importantly, there is a much larger decrease in the f-score, which decreases from 0.7414 to 0.6597. This metric is more valuable in the context of this problem, as described in section 4, and since there is a significant decrease in this score, it could be deduced that the optimized model should not be trained on the reduced data."
